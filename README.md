# Fake Shopping Store

This project refers to the [Shopping Cart](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) project from TOP.

> [!NOTE]
> The decisions made for the development of this project do not constitute what I would think as ideal, they were made based in what I wanted to practice at the time and taking into consideration the time limit I imposed upon myself.

## Technologies/concepts utilized:

- Framework (frontend): React[^1]
- Design philosophy: Desktop-First[^2]
- Styling: CSS Modules[^3]
- Routing: Client-Side
- Packet Manager: npm
- Bundler: Vite
- Documentation: clean code and PropTypes[^4]
- No WCAG 2 check[^5]

[^1]: I know that I'm not actually using a React based framework, but the project was conceptualized with components(React) in mind, so close enough.
[^2]: In the future I will make the page responsive, but for now the only place that it's expected to work properly is on desktop.
[^3]: I really wanted to fully commit to the idea of reusability of React components(one of its biggest themes), so using CSS Modules was the way to go for having the styles directly linked to each component without going the CSS-in-JS route.
[^4]: For this project the closest to a documentation that I will implement will be to make sure the code is as self explanatory as possible (following concepts of clean code) and properly indicating the expected arguments of components. In the future, proper description will be inserted in the components.
[^5]: This will also be addressed in the future. Probably I will not try to get an AA clearance but instead making sure that the page will provide a pleasant experience for whoever is using it.
